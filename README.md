This project taught me how to build an interactive Python quiz game using functions and user input.  
I learned how to read questions from a CSV file, process user answers, and provide instant feedback.  
Additionally, I practiced handling file operations and implementing basic scoring logic.  
Overall, this helped reinforce my understanding of Python basics and file I/O.
